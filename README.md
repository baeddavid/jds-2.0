# JDS 2.0
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.1-Brightgreen)

JDS 2.0 is my new refactored JavaScript data structures library. Using C++ and some cool npm packages, we can run and compile C++ code directly into node.js. All the data structures are written in
C++ for performance reasons and are exposed via JavaScript.

## What is JDS 2.0 for

JDS 2.0 is meant for practicing data structures/algorithms but will slowly be patched so that it can be used for project development.

## Current Progress

Currently JDs 2.0 is in development stages. Due to other commitments (maintaining JDS 1.0 and other fun things) development on this project has slowed down.

I've also made the data structures to be template friendly only to realize that emscripten does not like template definitions when it attempts to compile code. I am currently in the works for devising a work around.

## Contributing

This is an open source project! So fork it, edit stuff, add stuff, go wild.
