# JDS
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.0.1-Brightgreen)

JDS 2.0 is my new refactored JavaScript data structures library. Using C++ and some cool npm packages, we can run and compile C++ code directly into node.js. All the data structures are written in
C++ for performance reasons and are exposed via JavaScript.

## What is JDS for

JDS 2.0 is meant for practicing data structures/algorithms but will slowly be patched so that it can be used for project development.

## Contributing

This is an open source project! So fork it, edit stuff, add stuff, go wild.

## Data Structures

| Type  | Data Structure |
